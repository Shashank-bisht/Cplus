#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

//iostream is the header file help in input and output and manymore
// int main is the entry point for the program from where the program starts

// A namespace is designed to overcome this difficulty and is used as additional information to differentiate similar functions, classes, variables etc. with the same name available in different libraries

// Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.

int main(){
    // std::cout is used to output a value
    // std::cout<<"hello world";
    cout<<"hello "<<endl;
    return 0;
}
